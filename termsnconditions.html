Statement of Rights and Responsibilities
This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Cinehome Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Cinehome, as well as Cinehome brands, products and services, which we call the “cinehome Services” or “Services”. By using or accessing the Cinehome Services, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 13 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Cinehome works.
Because Cinehome provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict.
Privacy

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Cinehome to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.</p>
